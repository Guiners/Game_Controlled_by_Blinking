# Game Controlled by Blinking


A game developed using the Pygame library during university involves a player wearing three electrodes attached to their faceâ€”one near each ear and one between the eyebrows. Every time the player blinks, the character changes direction by 90 degrees. The player collects points, similar to the Snake game mechanics. Accumulating points increases the player's speed. If the player touches the screen border, they lose. The blink detection mechanism is based on Raspberry Pi.

## Features: 

- Control by blinking
- Music in background
- Playing as my colleague
